# Picker for Unsplash Photos
An Android library that provides a picker UI for choosing photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)'s photo collection.
It uses the [Unsplash API](https://api.unsplash.com/) to show a list of photos and allows the user to
choose one.

# License
The library source code is licensed under [the MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), except
as otherwise noted in certain files (i.e. the `maven-push.gradle` file, which is not a part of the library
itself). The MIT License is a fairly permissive license, so it shouldn't be hard to integrate Picker for
Unsplash Photos into your Android project.
